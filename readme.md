Automated Resume & Cover Letter Generator for LinkedIn Job Posts

This repository hosts community submissions for a hackathon project focused on automating the job application pipeline with Make.com (Integromat) and AI tools.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Job applications often require manual tailoring of resumes and cover letters for each posting, which is time-consuming and repetitive. These automations solve that by:

Fetching latest LinkedIn job posts via RSS feeds.

Extracting key job details (title, company, recruiter info, skills, posting date).

Analyzing job descriptions with OpenAI to generate:

Tailored resume (aligned with job requirements).

Tailored cover letter (storytelling-driven, company specific).

Converting generated HTML â†’ PDFs with PDF.co.

Uploading files to OneDrive/Google Drive for easy sharing.

Logging all job details and file links into Google Sheets for centralized tracking.
